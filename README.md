# About The Project

- EngageEarn is a platform for communities to reward contributors. Communities create campaigns and offer rewards to users who complete specified tasks. For example, to increase engagement on a Twitter post, you can set up a campaign, assign rewards for verified participation, and encourage people to interact with your post to boost your online presence.

# Why We Built

- We built EngageEarn to address the challenges faced by communities in rewarding their contributors. During our stay in Mu Chiang Mai, a popup city in Thailand similar to Zuzalu, we realized that there was a need to reward individuals who engaged with the community on social media platforms like Twitter. These contributors played a key role in promoting Mu but were not receiving any incentives. We wanted to create a platform, EngageEarn, that would allow community members to be rewarded and satisfied.

# How it works

- EngageEarn is built using Sismo, Spark's sDAI, and Tableland. The following describes why we have chosen these tools:

- Spark: We use the sDAI protocol from Spark to access risk-minimized yield and increase the community's funds. Instead of leaving the community fund idle in the treasury, it can gain access to the yield from sDAI and also gain exposure to RWA (Risk Weighted Assets) like t-bills.

- Sismo: We use Sismo to verify that a campaign participant has actually completed the required task, such as liking a Twitter post or fixing an issue on GitHub. Furthermore, verifying the Sismo proof adds a cost to participating, which helps prevent Twitter bot farms.

- Tableland: We are using Tableland to create a table for campaign reward distribution and campaign creation. This will provide an intuitive dashboard for managing the campaign.
